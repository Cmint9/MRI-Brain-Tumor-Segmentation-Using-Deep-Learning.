# Lecture 4: Frequency Analysis

Discrete Fourier Transform: 离散傅里叶变换：

The discrete Fourier transform provides a way to represent discrete-time signals or linear time-invariant systems in the frequency domain.
It serves as a valuable tool for analyzing discrete-time system. 
DFT is utilized in the spectral analysis of signals. 



FFT Methods: Fast Fourier Transform 
The computation of an N-point DFT requires O(N^2) operations, which increases rapidly with N. The 
Cooley-Tukey algorithm is a fast algorithm.

There are two visions: 
Decimation-in-time 时间内消灭
Decimation-in-frequency 频率衰减法

Decimation-in-time FFT： 
In computing the N-point DFT via FFT, we can assume that N is a power of 2. If N is not a power of 2, then we pad the sequence with zeros to make N a power of 2. 
 
How will we use the DFT and FFT?
