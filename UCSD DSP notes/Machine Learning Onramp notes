Here is notes part when I am learning, Machine Learning Onramp: 

# 1 Look at the scatter plot and find the color representing the letters r and s. You may want to uncheck Show for all the other letters.
Assignment: Select lastXpos as the X predictor and lastYpos as the Y predictor in the scatter plot.

# 2 You can evaluate the performance of the trained model by looking at the accuracy. Ideally, you want that number to get close to 100%. Typically, you'll need to try different models and adjust things to improve accuracy.
点训练全部，就可以训练一整个model了。 中间可能会出现验证混淆矩阵
To train and evaluate other classification models, select them from the Models section in the toolstrip. Clicking Train All again only trains draft models. Models that have been previously trained are not retrained. 
If you want to train specific models, you can click Train Selected instead.
Assignment:  

#3 Assignment: You can use the readtable function to import tabular data from a spreadsheet or text file and store the result as a table.
mytable = readtable("myfile.xlsx");
This code imports the data from the spreadsheet myfile.xlsx and stores it in a table named mytable.
letter = readtable('w.txt');

#4 assignement: To visualize the letter, you can plot the x and y letter coordinates. You can use dot notation to refer to any individual variable within a table.
plot(mytable.Xdata,mytable.Ydata)
plot(letter.X, letter.Y)

#assignment5: The default axis limits adjust to the height and width of each letter. To be able to see how different letters were written in the same space,
you can use the axis function to set the x and y axis limits.
axis([xmin xmax ymin ymax])
axis([-1 1 -1 1])

# assignment6: You can use * as a wildcard, or placeholder, to make a datastore to files or folders matching a particular pattern. For example, "user*.xlsx" will look for any XLSX files starting with the word "user."
ds = datastore("user*.xlsx");
The handwriting data files have names of the form user003_r_2.txt, that is, XXX_r_XXX.txt, so you need to use two wildcards for these files.

letterds =datastore(*_r_*.xlsx");
# read file data = read(letterds)
