## Denoising and Enhancement of Brain MRI Images Using DSP Filtering Techniques. 
  * Objective：
    * The aim of this project is to improve the visual quality of MRI images of the brain by removing noise and enhancing structural detail using Digital Signal Processing （DSP） methods in MATLAB. The aim is to visualize anatomical features more clearly, which may help in diagnostic imaging.
  * Background and Motivation: 
   * Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important tool for the diagnosis of neurological disorders. However, MRI images are often affected by Gaussian noise, motion artifacts, or acquisition-related distortions that may blur important anatomical structures thereby. Therefore, we can reduce the noise by applying DSP-based filtering and enhancement techniques so that we can preserve critical details while ultimately improving the clarity and interpretability of the images for further analysis or segmentation.
