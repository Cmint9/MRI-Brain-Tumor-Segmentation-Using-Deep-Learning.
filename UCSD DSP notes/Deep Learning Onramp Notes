# Assignment You can use the imread function to import images stored in most standard file formats, such as GIF, JPEG, and PNG.

This command reads the specified image and stores it in a MATLAB variable called I.
I = imread("filename.png");
任务
Import the JPG file file01 into the MATLAB workspace. Store the image in a variable called img1.

img1 = imread('file01.jpg')

# Assignment2 You can use the imshow function to display an image that is stored in a MATLAB variable:
imshow(I)
任务
Display the imported image in the img1 variable.

imshow(img1)

# Assignment3 You can create a copy of a pretrained deep network using the imagePretrainedNetwork function.
net = imagePretrainedNetwork
By default, the function provides a deep network named “SqueezeNet.” This network was trained on a data set called ImageNet, which contains 1000 classes, or categories.
任务
Use the imagePretrainedNetwork function to load a pretrained network. Save the result as a variable called net.

net = imagePretrainedNetwork

# Assignment4 You can use the minibatchpredict function to predict the subject of an image. The result is a vector of prediction scores, one for each class that the network net can predict.
scores = minibatchpredict(net,img)
The term "mini-batch" is in the function name because this function can also predict the contents of multiple images. You'll learn more about this term later in the course.
任务Use the minibatchpredict function with the pretrained network net to predict the subject of the image stored in the img1 variable. 
Store the network's prediction in a variable called s.
To see the result, don't use a semicolon at the end of the command.
s = minibatchpredict(net,img1)

#Assignment5 To get the list of potential classes, add a second output argument from imagePretrainedNetwork.
[net,classNames] = imagePretrainedNetwork
任务Add a second output to the code from task one to get the names of classes. Name the variable classes.
To see the list of names, don't use a semicolon at the end of the command.
[net,classes] = imagePretrainedNetwork

# Assignment6 You can consider the class name with the highest score as the network's label for the image. You can get this label with the scores2label function.
label = scores2label(scores,classNames)
任务Save the class name with the highest prediction score to a variable named c.
c = scores2label(s,classes)

# Assignment 7 Using the functions you learned earlier in the previous tasks, add commands to the script so that it makes predictions of the content of the images in img2 and img3. 
Store the classes with the highest prediction score in variables called c2 and c3, respectively.
To see the class names, omit the semicolon.
s2 = minibatchpredict(net, img2)
c2= scores2label(s2,classes)

s3 = minibatchpredict(net, img3)
c3 = scores2label(s3,classes)

# Assignment 8: Some of the network's top predictions are incorrect. For example, the second image contains a cat, yet the network classifies it as the dog breed toy terrier.
Different pretrained networks can have different behavior, so you can try importing another network by specifying a network name to imagePretrainedNetwork. 
[n,c] = imagePretrainedNetwork("name")
任务
Add an input to the command from task 1. Use the network name "googlenet" to import GoogLeNet.
[net, classes] = imagePretrainedNetwork('googlenet')

[if we want to use deep learning on MATLAB, we need to open Deep Network Designer]

# What is CNN(convultion neural netwrok)? 
CNN is made of layers, information is passed between those layers. Also, CNNs are specialized neral netwroks designed for inputs with a 
two-dimensional structure, such as images. 

The bulk of the network turns into the input image. The type/order chosen by the architect
