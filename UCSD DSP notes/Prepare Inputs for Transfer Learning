## Set training set 
# Assignment1: What options can you set to control network training? You can see the available options for a chosen training algorithm by using the trainingOptions function.

This command creates a variable called opts that contains the default options for the specified training algorithm.
opts = trainingOptions("algorithm")

To use stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM), specify "sgdm".
任务
Create a variable called opts with the default training algorithm options for the SGDM optimizer. Omit the semicolon at the end of the line to display the result.
opts = trainingOptions("sgdm")

## Assignment 2: You can specify any number of settings as optional name-value arguments in the trainingOptions function.
opts = trainingOptions("sgdm",Name=value)
任务
Update the variable called opts to set InitialLearnRate to 0.001.
opts = trainingOptions("sgdm",InitialLearnRate=0.001)

## Assignment3: By default, you'll monitor the loss value during training to see how the network is learning. You can add additional metrics with the Metrics name-value argument. For classification problems, it's common to monitor both loss and accuracy.
opts = trainingOptions(...,Metrics="accuracy")
任务
Update the variable called opts to set Metrics to "accuracy".
opts = trainingOptions("sgdm",InitialLearnRate=0.001,Metrics="accuracy")
