Nonuniform Sampling

The signal from the PAX seismic station is not uniformly sampled. Uniformly sampled signals have equal spacing between every point, 
but some of the samples in the pax signal were recorded with a small delay.

Most spectral analysis techniques require signals to be uniformly sampled, so Signal Analyzer interpolates the signal to a uniform grid when you view the power spectrum. 
To establish a consistent time base for all three signals, you can resample the pax signal uniformly 50 Hz.
