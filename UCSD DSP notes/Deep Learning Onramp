# Assignment You can use the imread function to import images stored in most standard file formats, such as GIF, JPEG, and PNG.

This command reads the specified image and stores it in a MATLAB variable called I.
I = imread("filename.png");
任务
Import the JPG file file01 into the MATLAB workspace. Store the image in a variable called img1.

img1 = imread('file01.jpg')

# Assignment2 You can use the imshow function to display an image that is stored in a MATLAB variable:
imshow(I)
任务
Display the imported image in the img1 variable.

imshow(img1)

# Assignment2 You can create a copy of a pretrained deep network using the imagePretrainedNetwork function.
net = imagePretrainedNetwork
By default, the function provides a deep network named “SqueezeNet.” This network was trained on a data set called ImageNet, which contains 1000 classes, or categories.
任务
Use the imagePretrainedNetwork function to load a pretrained network. Save the result as a variable called net.
